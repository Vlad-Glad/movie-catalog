# Laboratory Work: Database Forms, Queries and Reports

## Objective
The goal of this laboratory work is to design and implement a small database system with user-friendly forms, parameterized queries, and reports. The project demonstrates working with relational data, input validation, and navigation through a simple web interface.

## Domain
**Film Industry** â€” entities include:
- Movies
- Directors
- Actors
- Genres

The system is implemented on top of a relational database and provides forms for managing these entities.

## Features

### Forms
- Main menu with navigation to all sections (Movies, Directors, Actors, Genres)
- Data entry, editing, and browsing through dedicated forms
- Input validation with hints and restrictions (e.g., correct format for numeric and text fields)
- Return-to-menu option on every page

### Queries
The system supports at least 5 parameterized queries, including:
1. Search movies by genre  
2. Search movies by director  
3. Search movies by actor  
4. Find actors who appeared in more than *X* movies  
5. Find directors who directed more than *X* movies  
6. Find actors who appeared in the same movies as a given actor  
7. Find directors who directed all movies of a given genre  
8. Find pairs of actors with identical filmographies  

### Reports
- Display results in tabular form with clear formatting  
- Reports for movies, actors, directors, and query results  

## Usage
- Launch the application  
- Start from the **main menu** to access Movies, Directors, Actors, or Genres  
- Use the query section to run parameterized searches  
- View results directly in the browser in table format  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the creation of a database-driven application with forms, input validation, and SQL queries for the **film industry** domain. It fulfills all lab requirements: multiple related tables, user forms, at least 5 parameterized queries, and reports for user interaction.
